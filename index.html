<p><em>Federated learning</em> (abbreviated as <em>FL</em>) refers to the practice of conducting machine learning based on several users' data by having each user, given an initial global model by a central server, <em>locally train&nbsp;</em>a model on their local devices, then communicate their locally trained model to the central server, following which each user's local model is&nbsp;<em>aggregated&nbsp;</em>at the central server with that of others, and used to update the global model</p>
